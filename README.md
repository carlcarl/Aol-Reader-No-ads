## Description

Though Adblock can hide the ads, too. But there is still an empty space at the right side, which is a waste. `Aol Reader No-ads` can remove the ads at right side and also extend the article area to make it looks bigger!!

If you are using Aol Reader, you may want to install this :)

## Usage

Just install this and it will automatically work for you.
